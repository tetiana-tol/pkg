Additional resources can be found in the main search areas of the website. Investigate the events and impacts of World War II with your students using primary resources, museum exhibits and learning activities from the National Museum of American History.  To control the form of war messages, the government created the U.S. Office of War Information in June 1942. OWI sought to review and approve the design and distribution of government posters. Posters such as this one and their messages were seen as \"war graphics,\" combining the sophisticated style of contemporary graphic design with the promotion of war aims. Over time, OWI developed six war-information themes for its own internal use, as well as to guide other issuing agencies and major producers of mass-media entertainment. Use a video clip and primary sources to develop an understanding of the challenges facing the ground troops during World War II’s Battle of the Bulge, then take on the role of one of those soldiers and write a letter home. This lesson plan (which includes background information and full-color primary sources) was produced to accompany the exhibition , by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The story of America includes the history of those who have lived through extraordinary circumstances. One such person was Camilla Gottlieb, whose ordinary life in Vienna suddenly became endangered when the Germans invaded and annexed Austria in 1938. As a Jew, she confronted devastating changes. With their Jewish heritage reviled and their Austrian citizenship revoked, Camilla and her husband Hermann recognized their peril and attempted to come to the United States. Kick-off a research project on gender roles on the World War II home front with two brief video clips and a selection of primary sources. Once students have analyzed the photographs and wartime advertisements, begin a research project on women during World War II. This lesson plan (which includes background information and full-color primary sources) was produced to accompany the exhibition , by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. The ENIAC was a large, general-purpose digital computer built to compute ballistics tables for U.S. Army artillery during World War II. Occupying a room 30 feet by 50 feet, ENIAC—the Electrical Numerical Integrator and Computer—weighed 30 tons and used some 18,000 vacuum tubes. It could compute 1,000 times faster than any existing device. Technicians used external plug wires, like those shown here, to program the machine. While leg makeup has been commercially available since the 1920s, it wasn't until rationing was introduced during the World War II that the product became an essential commodity for many American women. Unable to procure silk or nylon hose, many women resorted to painting their legs with products such as Leg Silque Liquid Stockings, made in Boston, Mass., by the Langlors Company. Some industrious users even drew black lines down the backs of their legs to simulate the seams. In this OurStory module entitled Life in a WWII Japanese American Internment Camp, students will learn about the lives of Japanese American children who were forced to leave their homes and move to internment camps during World War II. The module includes links to hands-on activities, pertinent websites, and a list of recommended readings. OurStory is a series of modules designed to help children and adults enjoy exploring history together through the use of objects from the Museum's vast collections, quality children's literature, and engaging hands-on activities. Ideal for afterschool use, OurStory resources allow students to think critically, to be creative, and to achieve academic standards both in and out of the classroom. Through the use of use of authentic magazine covers, objects from the museum's collections, a timeline and brief video news clips, students will explore the themes of the home front during World War II: the war effort; the ideals that were fought for, the diverse audiences that were targeted, and the varying uses of cover design by different companies. This resource is part of the online exhibition entitled . Listen to oral history recordings and examine related primary source materials to learn the stories of the men and women who built and sailed on Liberty Ships to support the allied war effort during World War II. The Web site encourages students to take on the role of historian by presenting them with a variety of related primary source materials and historical questions. These resources are part of the online exhibition . Take a close look at propaganda cartoons and other primary sources to analyze how young Americans were mobilized for the War. This lesson plan (which includes background information and full-color primary sources) was produced to accompany the exhibition , by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. During World War II, the United States government forcibly removed over 120,000 Japanese Americans from the Pacific Coast. These individuals, two-thirds of them U.S. citizens, were sent to ten camps built throughout the western interior of the United States. Many would spend the next three years living under armed guard, behind barbed wire. In this webcast, the panelists explored this period in American history and considered how fear and prejudice can upset the delicate balance between the rights of citizens and the power of the state. Religion has an essential role in military history, which is reflected in military material. Steel-covered New Testaments were popular keepsake gifts for soldiers going off to fight in World War II. Advertised in newspapers and magazines as protection from bullets, the small books were designed to be carried in the pocket over one's heart as both symbol and shield. Students will learn about the personal experiences of Japanese American incarcerees during World War II and will practice communicating information concisely by developing an original comic. Through the use of a description of the apartment, an excerpt from Mary Scott's diary, and artifact from the period, students will learn about life on the home front during World War II. The Scotts rented apartment on the first floor of an Ipswich, Massachusetts house became a home front battlefield during World War II. The Scotts are one of the families that lived in the Ipswich, Massachusetts house which is the focus of , an online exhibition. This collection teaches students about the changing role of women during World War II: their role in the workplace, increasing presence in the military, and participation in voluntary organizations that supported the war. Students should think about how these activities reinforced traditional notions of gender divisions while they also allowed women to experience new activities. Students will learn how Americans joined the Allies to defeat Axis militarism and nationalist expansion. Sixteen million Americans donned uniforms in this section of the online exhibition . The millions more who stayed home comprised a vast civilian army, mobilized by the government to support the war effort. The world-wide conflict that led to the emergence of the United States as an economic and military superpower is divided into sections that allow students to focus either on a specific aspect of the war, or the conflict as a whole. The sections included are titled: Axis Aggression, America Enters the War, Mobilizing for War, \"You're in the Army Now\", Battle of the Atlantic, The Mediterranean Theater, Storming Fortress Europe, The Pacific Theater; So Others Might Fight; Morale Boosters and Victory and Peace. A non-flash version of the site is available: . This image, said to be the most popular poster design of World War II, appeared as a billboard in 1941. Carl Paulson created the design under the direction of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, Inc., for a U.S. Treasury Department campaign promoting the widespread public ownership of defense bonds and stamps. To demonstrate the power of advertising while selling bonds, the billboard industry displayed this image of the American flag at more than 30,000 locations in some 18,000 cities and towns across the country in March and April 1942. The Treasury brought back the billboard for campaigns in July 1942 and 1943. To meet public demand for copies of the billboard, the Government Printing Office printed 4 million small color reproductions. to guide students through describing the object and analyzing its meaning.

They were the largest military conflicts in human history. Both wars involved military alliances between different groups of countries. World War I (a.k.a the First World War, the Great War, the War To End All Wars) was centered on Europe. The world warring nations were divided into two groups namely ‘The Central Powers’ and ‘The Allied Powers’. The central powers group consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Bulgaria. The Allied powers group consisted of France, , Russia, Italy, Japan, Canada and (from 1917) the U.S. World War II (a.k.a the Second World War), the opposing alliances are now referred to as ‘The Axis’ and ‘The Allies’. The Axis group consisted of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Allies group consisted of France, Britain, the U.S., the Soviet Union, Canada and China. World War II was especially heinous because of the genocide of Jewish people perpetrated by . This video from Yale explains the events that led to World War I:  The signed at the end of World War I not only lay the moral blame of the conflict on Germany but also forced the Germans to make huge payments to the victors of the war. France and Britain needed these reparations payments in order to pay down their own debts. But they were highly onerous, arguably unjustifiably so, and were deeply unpopular in Germany. Hitler seized on this growing resentment and promised to \"undo this injustice and tear up this treaty and restore Germany to its old greatness\". In fact, the payments demanded were so large that Germany was able to repay the final installment of interest on this debt only on October 3, 2010. The following causes of World War II are generally acknowledged: The following documentary delves into the causes of World War II:  The sequence of events for World War I began in 1914 with Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia on 28 July 1914 in a bid to reassert its authority as a Balkan power. With war breaking out between Austria-Hungary on one side and Serbia on the other, Europe quickly fell back to the alliances nations had formed. Austria-Hungary and Germany were allies. Serbia was allied with Russia; as was France. Russia aided Serbia and attacked Austria. So Austria-Hungary was fighting in two fronts with Serbia and with Russia and consequently lost on both fronts. In a bid to aid Austria-Hungary against Russia, and fearing an attack from France, Germany mobilized its army and attacked France.     A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919 The war that broke out in 1939 was a war for the European balance of power. The immediate cause of the conflict was the German demand for the return of Danzig and part of the Polish ‘corridor’ granted to Poland from German territory in the Versailles Treaty of 1919. Poland refused to agree to German demands, and on 1 September 1939 overwhelming German forces launched the Polish campaign and defeated her in three weeks. Russia also invaded eastern Poland. Poland thus got divided into two parts. In March 1939 Britain and France had guaranteed Polish sovereignty, and in honor of that pledge first demanded that German forces withdraw, and then on 3 September declared war on Germany. America was committed by the Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1937 of non-intervention in overseas conflicts. This video presents a concise history of the events of World War II:      The entry of the USA signaled a change in the political balance of the war of great significance. German forces in Stalingrad surrendered in January 1943and by May 1943 Italian and German forces finally surrendered in Tunisia, enabling the Allies to mount the invasion of Sicily and then Italy. Italy sued for an armistice in September 1943.  American economic might and political interests helped to bind together the different fronts of conflict, while America's worldwide system of supply and logistics provided the sinews of war necessary to complete the defeat of the aggressor states. A major intelligence deception operation and declining air power weakened the German response and by September 1944 German forces had been driven from France.  Many of the weapons that dominate military operations today were developed during World War I, including the machine gun, the tank and specialized combat aircraft. This is a great video that explains the military used during World War I.  Share this comparison: If you read this far, you should follow us:  \"World War I vs World War II.\" Diffen LLC, n.d.

World War II You are here  Pages   Pages   Pages  Pages  Pages  Pages  Pages The Ohio State University Department of History   World War II, one the darkest periods in the history of the world, raged from 1939 to 1945 and involved almost the entire world. Countries were destroyed, created or changed forever. Fifty million people lost their lives between 1939 and 1945 and hundreds of millions more suffered injuries and wounds. Yet many today do not know when, where, or by whom the war was fought or that their fathers and grandfathers fought battles from the volcanic islands of the South Pacific Ocean to the icy waters of the North Atlantic; or from the jungles of Burma to the deserts of North Africa; or from the grassy steppes of Russia to the skies over Britain. We offer this overview of World War II in the hope that some may gain a better understanding and become interested in continuing to learn more. There is a lot to know about history's most widespread and destructive war, but there is no better place to start than eHistory's World War II area. (Image of ,) ( ) " .

        <schema:text>         "The Scientific and Technological Advances of World War II | The National WWII Museum | New Orleans The war effort demanded developments in the field of science and technology, developments that forever changed life in America and made present-day technology possible. Of the enduring legacies from a war that changed all aspects of life—from economics, to justice, to the nature of warfare itself—the scientific and technological legacies of World War II had a profound and permanent effect on life after 1945. Technologies developed during World War II for the purpose of winning the war found new uses as commercial products became mainstays of the American home in the decades that followed the war’s end. Wartime medical advances also became available to the civilian population, leading to a healthier and longer-lived society. Added to this, advances in the technology of warfare fed into the development of increasingly powerful weapons that perpetuated tensions between global powers, changing the way people lived in fundamental ways. The scientific and technological legacies of World War II became a double-edged sword that helped usher in a modern way of living for postwar Americans, while also launching the conflicts of the Cold War. When looking at wartime technology that gained commercial value after World War II, it is impossible to ignore the small, palm-sized device known as a . This device not only proved essential in helping to win World War II, but it also forever changed the way Americans prepared and consumed food. This name of the device—the cavity magnetron—may not be as recognizable as what it generates: . During World War II, the ability to produce shorter, or micro, wavelengths through the use of a cavity magnetron improved upon prewar radar technology and resulted in increased accuracy over greater distances. Radar technology played a significant part in World War II and was of such importance that some historians have claimed that radar helped the Allies win the war more than any other piece of technology, including the atomic bomb. After the war came to an end, cavity magnetrons found a new place away from war planes and aircraft carrier and instead became a common feature in American homes. Percy Spencer, an American engineer and expert in radar tube design who helped develop for combat, looked for ways to apply that technology for commercial use after the end of the war. The common story told claims that Spencer took note when a candy bar he had in his pocket melted as he stood in front of an active radar set. Spencer began to experiment with different kinds of food, such as popcorn, opening the door to commercial microwave production. Putting this wartime technology to use, commercial microwaves became increasingly available by the 1970s and 1980s, changing the way Americans prepared food in a way that persists to this day. The ease of heating food using microwaves has made this technology an expected feature in the twenty first century American home. More than solely changing the way Americans warm their food, radar became an essential component of . The development and application of radar to the study of weather began shortly after the end of World War II. Using radar technology, meteorologists advanced knowledge of weather patterns and increased their ability to predict weather forecasts. By the 1950s, radar became a key way for meteorologists to track rainfall, as well as storm systems, advancing the way Americans followed and planned for daily changes in the weather. Similar to radar technology, had been in development well before the start of World War II. However, the war demanded rapid progression of such technology, resulting in the production of new computers of unprecedented power. One such example was the (ENIAC), one of the first general purpose computers. Capable of performing thousands of calculations in a second, ENIAC was originally designed for military purposes, but it was not completed until 1945. Building from wartime developments in computer technology, the US government released ENIAC to the general public early in 1946, presenting the computer as tool that would revolutionize the field of mathematics. Taking up 1,500 square feet with 40 cabinets that stood nine feet in height, ENIAC came with a $400,000 price tag. The availability of ENIAC distinguished it from other computers and marked it as a significant moment in the history of computing technology. By the 1970s, the patent for the ENIAC computing technology entered the public domain, lifting restrictions on modifying these technological designs. Continued development over the following decades made computers progressively smaller, more powerful, and more affordable. Along with the advances of microwave and computer technology, World War II brought forth momentous changes in field of surgery and . The devastating scale of both world wars demanded the development and use new medical techniques that led to improvements in, , and other advances in . The need to treat millions of soldiers also necessitated the large-scale production of , bringing about one of the most important advances in medicine in the twentieth century. Even though the scientist Alexander Fleming discovered the antibacterial properties of the Penicillium notatum mold in 1928, commercial production of did not begin until after the start of World War II. As American and British scientists worked collectively to meet the needs of the war, the large-scale production of penicillin became a necessity. Men and women together experimented with deep tank fermentation, discovering the process needed for the mass manufacture of penicillin. In advance of the Normandy invasion in 1944, scientists prepared 2.3 million doses of penicillin, bringing awareness of this “miracle drug” to the public. As the war continued, advertisements heralding penicillin’s benefits, established the antibiotic as a wonder drug responsible for saving millions of lives. From World War II to today, penicillin remains a critical form of treatment used to ward off bacterial infection. Penicillin Saves Soldiers Lives poster.

Developed in the midst of a race between the Axis and Allied powers during the war, the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki serve as notable markers to the end of fighting in the Pacific. While debates over the decision to use atomic weapons on civilian populations continue to persist, there is little dispute over the extensive ways the atomic age came to shape the twentieth century and the standing of the United States on the global stage. Competition for dominance propelled both the United States and the Soviet Union to manufacture and hold as many nuclear weapons as possible. From that arms race came a new era of science and technology that forever changed the nature of diplomacy, the size and power of military forces, and the development of technology that ultimately put American astronauts on the surface of the moon. The arms race in nuclear weapons that followed World War II sparked fears that one power would not only gain superiority on earth, but inspace itself. During the mid-twentieth century, the prompted the creation of a new federally-run program in . In the wake of the successful launch of the Soviet satellite, , in 1957, the United States responded by launching its own satellite, , four months later. In 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Act (NASA) received approval from the US Congress to oversee the effort to send humans into space. The Space Race between the United States and the USSR ultimately peaked with the landing of the Apollo 11 crew on the surface of the moon on July 20, 1969. The Cold War between the United States and the USSR changed aspects of life in almost every way, but both the nuclear arms and Space Race remain significant legacies of the science behind World War II. From microwaves to space exploration, the scientific and technological advances of World War II forever changed the way people thought about and interacted with technology in their daily lives. The growth and sophistication of military weapons throughout the war created new uses, as well as new conflicts, surrounding such technology. World War II allowed for the creation of new commercial products, advances in medicine, and the creation of new fields of scientific exploration. Almost every aspect of life in the United States today—from using home computers, watching the daily weather report, and visiting the doctor—are all influenced by this enduring legacy of World War II. From the Collection to the Classroom: Teaching History with The National WWII Museum. Kristen D. Burton is the Teacher Programs and Curriculum Specialist at The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, LA. The Big three met at Potsdam, Germany, in the summer of 1945 to discuss the fate of the world after World War II. The experiences of those left to support the war effort on the Home Front, combined with those of returning veterans, helped further reveal underlying tensions and led to significant changes in the social history of the United States. Join The National WWII Museum as we commemorate the surrender of Nazi Germany and V-E Day by taking a look back at the events of the year after surrender and how they shaped the modern world with Dr. Rob Citino, Samuel Zemurray Stone Senior Historian and the Executive Director, The Institute for the Study of War and Democracy. On April 21, 1946, two political parties united, creating a single, dominant party in what became East Germany. Join Museum educators to discuss the few Americans who saw the atrocities of the Holocaust with their own eyes. The Museum highlights educational resources for teachers and students that can be used to explore Japanese American incarceration. Join us for an engaging roundtable discussion regarding the experiences of those who did the liberating and those who were liberated in Europe in 1945, and how institutions and scholars preserve and teach this history.

        <schema:text>         "Differences and Similarities: World War I and World War II | History Daily What in history? Was it the same motivating factors that caused the Second World War or was it something totally different? There are many theories on what started World War I. Various factors led up to the start of the war. Certain empires were trying to increase their empire, claiming more territory and therefore, more resources from those territories. As these empires were sizing each other up, tensions began to increase. All it took then was just a spark like a match to a gas-soaked log of wood to ignite the fire. That spark was the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand and wife, Sophia of Austria. The icing on the cake was also Serbia fighting for independence. With all the countries having aligned themselves with each other in various treaties, they all had a stake in what happened between the two small countries. It came down to a power struggle as one by one, more and more countries were thrown into the mix through binding agreements to defend each other. The world was split between the two groups: the Central Powers and the Allied Powers. World War I officially began in 1914 as the teams were picked. The Central Powers were Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey (Ottoman Empire), and Bulgaria. The Allied Powers were France, Britain, Russia, Italy, Japan, and the U.S. However, the world did not learn from the first world war and all their good intentions of not fighting again went out the window. It was just 21 years later when took place. This time the war was even more intense and lasted even longer – six years rather than four years. The world once again took sides in 1939 with Germany, Italy, and Japan on the side of the Axis Group going up against France, Britain, U.S. Russia, and China as the Allied Powers. Hitler’s Revenge: With Adolf Hitler as a soldier in the first world war, he saw firsthand how unprepared and outnumbered Germany was. He was definitely not happy about the outcome for Germany. Because things did not go well for them and because they had to pay for their war crimes, he wanted revenge. Not only was his motives political but he also had an idealism for an Aryan-only race. This was his motivation for attempting to wipe out the Jewish race and also because he blamed them for the war. Besides wiping out the Jews, he also wanted to take out anyone else who did not agree with his methods or who were sympathizers to the Jewish race. The war this time was purposely started by Germany, led by Hitler, who attacked Poland, drawing in Britain and France as they retaliated. From there, it broadened once again as the Allied Forces rejoined. More advanced weaponry was used this time with more modern tanks, submarines, airplanes, and the introduction of nuclear missiles and covert operations. One of the weapons used mostly by the western Allies during World War II was called the Bofors 40 mm gun, which was an anti-aircraft autocannon. It was highly effective as a defense mechanism for ground, naval, or air forces. Germany had come up with a new method called Blitzkrieg. Their plan was to attack and move quickly in order to be able to surprise their enemies and cover more ground. When World War II finally ended in 1945, there were over 60 million deaths including civilians and those who died of war-related diseases and famines. It also resulted in the genocidal deaths of six million Jews. Once again, the war brought defeat to Germany and Japan; the rivalry between the U.S. and Russia as superpowers; and the United Nations were formed as another means to prevent future wars. Many of the Nazi leaders were put on trial and some were executed for their crimes against the Jews. A Peace Treaty was signed with Japan in 1951. There are similarities between the two wars. In both wars, a certain group of people were singled out for genocide. In both wars, certain empires were attempting to achieve world domination. The differences between the two wars are that, in the first one, it was more about domination of land and resources and in the second one, it was more about ideologies and creating a communist society. Has the world finally learned from the first two wars or is there yet another war on the horizon? A Third World War? Will people ever be able to live in peace with one another?

World War II had two primary theatres: The European Theatre and the Pacific Theatre. The Pacific Theatre of World War II was largely defined by the territories of the Empire of Japan. At its peak, the empire stretched throughout eastern China, southeast Asia, the islands of Oceania, and even the Aleutian islands in North America. Click through this timeline to see how battles dotted the Pacific Theatre between 1931 and 1945, and how the U.S. entry into the war following the attack on Pearl Harbor radically altered the war’s progress.

The Allied armies converged on Berlin. committed suicide on April 30, 1945, and the war in Europe ended on May 8. The American “island hopping” campaign had destroyed key Japanese installations throughout the while allowing bypassed islands to wither on the vine. Hundreds of thousands were killed in firebombings of Japanese cities, and the in August 1945 knocked Japan out of the war. Estimates of the total number of people killed during World War II have ranged from 35,000,000 to 60,000,000—a significant span, because statistics about the war’s casualties are inexact. The Soviet Union and China are believed to have suffered the most total casualties, while an estimated 5,800,000 Poles died, which represents about 20 percent of Poland’s prewar population. About 4,200,000 Germans died, and about 1,972,000 Japanese died. In all, the scale of human losses during World War II was vast.

The 40,000,000–50,000,000 deaths incurred in World War II make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history. Along with World War I, World War II was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It resulted in the extension of the Soviet Union’s power to nations of eastern , enabled a communist movement to eventually achieve power in China, and marked the decisive shift of power in the world away from the states of western Europe and toward the United States and the Soviet Union.  By the early part of 1939 the dictator had become determined to invade and occupy . Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked by Germany. Hitler intended to invade Poland anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour. Secret negotiations led on August 23–24 to the signing of the in . In a secret of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between them, with the western third of the country going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds being taken over by the U.S.S.R. Having achieved this agreement, the other provisions of which stupefied Europe even without divulgence of the secret protocol, Hitler thought that Germany could attack Poland with no danger of Soviet or British intervention and gave orders for the invasion to start on August 26. News of the signing, on August 25, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland (to supersede a previous though temporary agreement) caused him to postpone the start of hostilities for a few days. He was still determined, however, to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to restrain him. Finally, at 12:40 on August 31, 1939, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. The invasion began as ordered. In response, and declared war on Germany on September 3, at 11:00 and at 5:00 , respectively. World War II had begun.

The carnage of World War II was unprecedented and brought the world closest to the term “total warfare.” On average 27,000 people were killed each day between September 1, 1939, until the . Western technological advances had turned upon itself, bringing about the most destructive war in human history. The primary combatants were the Axis nations of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan, and the Allied nations, Great Britain (and its Commonwealth nations), the Soviet Union, and the United States. Seven days after the suicide of , Germany unconditionally surrendered on . The Japanese would go on to fight for nearly four more months until their , which was brought on by the on the Japanese towns of and . Despite winning the war, Britain largely lost much of its empire, which was outlined in the basis of the Atlantic Charter. The war precipitated the revival of the U.S. economy, and by the war’s end, the nation would have a gross national product that was nearly greater than all the Allied and Axis powers combined. The USA and USSR emerged from World War II as global superpowers. The fundamentally disparate, one-time allies became engaged in what was to be called the , which dominated world politics for the latter half of the 20th century.  Every issue of magazine is packed with powerful stories about the campaigns, commanders, strategies, and the everyday men and women who fought the world’s largest and deadliest conflict. Written by leading historians and journalists, uncovers fresh perspectives on the war’s triumphs and blunders. Special sections test your wits, showcase weapons, explore worldwide travel destinations for war buffs, and, in collaboration with the National WWII Museum, expertly answer readers’ questions about artifacts found in dusty attics or long-forgotten trunks. September 1, 1939 September 2, 1945 Europe, Pacific, Atlantic, South-East Asia, China, Middle East, Mediterranean, and Northern Africa The most destructive war in all of history, its exact cost in human lives is unknown, but casualties in World War II may have totaled over 60 million service personnel and civilians killed. Nations suffering the highest losses, military and civilian, in descending order, are: Some say it was simply a continuation of the that had theoretically ended in 1918. Others point to 1931, when Japan seized Manchuria from China. Others to Italy’s invasion and defeat of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935, Adolf Hitler’s re-militarization of Germany’s Rhineland in 1936, the (1936–1939), and Germany’s occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 are sometimes cited. The two dates most often mentioned as “the beginning of World War II” are July 7, 1937, when the “” led to a prolonged war between Japan and China, and , when , which led Britain and France to declare war on Hitler’s Nazi state in retaliation. From the invasion of Poland until the war ended with , most nations around the world were engaged in armed combat. No one historic event can be said to have been the origin of World War II. Japan’s unexpected victory over czarist Russia in the (1904-05) left open the door for Japanese expansion in Asia and the Pacific. The United States U.S. Navy first developed plans in preparation for a naval war with Japan in 1890. War Plan Orange, as it was called, would be updated continually as technology advanced and greatly aided the U.S. during World War II. The years between the first and second world wars were a time of instability. The that began on , 1929 plunged the worldwide recession. Coming to power in 1933, Hitler capitalized on this economic decline and the deep German resentment due to the emasculating , signed following the armistice of 1918. Declaring that Germany needed or “living space,” Hitler began to test the Western powers and their willingness to monitor the treaty’s provision. By 1935 Hitler had established the Luftwaffe, a direct violation of the 1919 treaty. Remilitarizing the Rhineland in 1936 violated Versailles and the Locarno Treaties (which defined the borders of Europe) once again. The Anschluss of Austria and the annexation of the rump of Czechoslovakia was a further extension of Hitler’s desire for Italy’s desire to create the Third Rome pushed the nation to closer ties with Nazi Germany. Likewise, Japan, angered by their exclusion in Paris in 1919, sought to create a Pan-Asian sphere with Japan in order to create a self-sufficient state. Competing ideologies further fanned the flames of international tension. The in czarist Russia during the First World War, followed by the Russian Civil War, had established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), a sprawling communist state. Western republics and capitalists feared the spread of Bolshevism. In some nations, such as Italy, Germany and Romania, ultra-conservative groups rose to power, in part in reaction to communism. Germany, Italy and Japan signed agreements of mutual support but, unlike the Allied nations they would face, they never developed a comprehensive or coordinated plan of action. “History is a guide to navigation in perilous times.
