## Use case
The PKGs have gained momentum in the last years for applications in multiple domains and downstream applications. Although the idea of theoretically applying them is predominant still, we present two use cases of practical implementations of the PKGs for web search, one in collaborative search and one in recommendations.

### PKGs in Collaborative Search Results

The PKGs have been introduced recently[^1] to assist the integration of a new visualisation interface in collaborative search history. 
Students often use search engines to learn more about a specific subject. However, the large number of documents provided as search results constitutes an obstacle, as students have to read, understand, analyse all the results. 
The problem addressed is that search engines support users in performing keyword-based searches, but they do not provide functionalities specifically designed to facilitate students' searches for learning tasks[^2].
Moreover, the collaboration between users is not enabled, hindering the possibility of implementing project-based learning or team-based learning activities.
The pkg ontology and PKGs we suggest can facilitate collaborative search and collaborative learning as presented by [^1] in the backend of a web search system application by providing personalised features and enhancing collaboration for users. 

### PKGs in Recommendations

A recent paper[^3] introduces PKGs in a mobile environment for the downstream task of recommendations. Their method integrates data from different personal resources in a simulated mobile environment with the usage of different mobile applications. The authors demonstrated preliminary positive results in user study that tested the capabilities of PKGs in recommendation of news, a social chatting app, and voice assistant. By incooporating the description of their ontology, our PKGs can be adjusted to their design and enhanced to accommodate multiple different applications.
